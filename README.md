Paste that into "input.txt" file, in the same directory as cleanupemail.py 
run the script from a command prompt 
bing bang boom, you've got a csv with just the email addresses. 
I use this for mailing from Word

--authsmtptestemail.py usage: 
This script takes user input for server, user, recipeint, password, etc and sends a test email. Useful for troubleshooting issues with SMTP failures on copiers and mailers. 


--recordchecker.py usage: 
it'll ask for domain input and check for A, MX, and txt records. Kinda just a faster way to do all.
